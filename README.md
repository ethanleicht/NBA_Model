# NBA_Model
Machine learning model to predict NBA game outcomes.

All files/folders in this repository are from the parent paper's code except the following:
- `nba_data/stats_archive`
- `nba_data/games_archive`
- `nba_data/our_df_final.csv`
- `nba_data/our_df_final2.csv`
- `our_code.py`
- `our_code2.ipynb`

`our_code.py` is our remodulation of the parent paper's original code in `full_code.ipynb`.

`our_code2.ipynb` includes all of our novelization work. This file pulls data from `nba_data/stats_archive` and `nba_data/games_archive`.

`nba_data/our_df_final.csv` and `nba_data/our_df_final2.csv` are the datasets created in `our_code2.ipynb`, containing our novel feature. These are the datasets upon which we conduct feature reduction and machine learning in `our_code2.ipynb`.
